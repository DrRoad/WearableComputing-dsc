# WearableComputing-dsc (course project)
General Topic: IoT data processing (from wearable devices)

In this course project, several tasks must be performed on data resulted from experiments published and described in [1]. In short, 30 volunteers (19-48 years old) performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone. Data was captured from the smartphone's accelerometer and gyroscope at a constant rate of 50Hz, and labeled manually. Finally, 70% of the volunteers' data was randomly selected as "training" data, and the remaining 30% as "test" data.

The course project consists in creating one R script "run_analysis.R" that:

<ol>
<li> Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
</li>
<li> Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
</li>
<li> Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
</li>
<li> Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
</li>
<li> From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
</li>
</ol>
